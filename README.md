# Google Search API - serplayer.com
Serplayer is a Google Search API that was created to be the missing API that Google never released.

This was the moment we decided to launch serplayer.com, a feature-complete google search API. 

The API uses keys to allow access to the API. You can register a free API key at our [developer portal](https://app.serplayer.com/register?plan=free). This will allow you to conduct 150 free searches per month. 

To provide you with the best developer experience possible, we also created a Postman collection covering all of our endpoints.
